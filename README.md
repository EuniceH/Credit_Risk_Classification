# Project Title


The credit risk resampling is a python jupyter lab interface program.  It  uses various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. It uses a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) - It's a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) - For Series, DataFrame, and plots

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - For adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - For Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

* [imblearn](https://pypi.org/project/imblearn/) - For balancing the datasets which are highly skewed or biased towards some classes. 


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install jupyterlab
  pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use the credit risk resampling, simply clone the `credit_risk from the respository, open jupyter lab and open **credit_risk_resampling.ipynb** with:

```python
jupyter lab
```

Re-run the jupyter book to produce learning prediction.
